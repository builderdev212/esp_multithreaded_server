# esp32-multithreaded-server
I've written a multithreaded server in python that can communicate with any amount of esp's and any amount of clients running on any other device.

The example I have configured connects to two different esp32's that can be controlled from a gui made with tkinter.

Keep in mind for my example to work you need to put in the wifi and server information into your espa and espb files.
